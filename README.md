# LLM Ethics Library
A Library for assessing the ethical capablilites of LLMs through prompting them with ethical dilemmas.

- Functions:
- Generating many variations of prompts
  - to make sure irrelevant factors like "output option ordering" or "dilemma formulation" have no siginficant impact on the results
- Prompting of LLMs (OpenAI ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or MistralAI)
  - utilizes [structured output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) to ensure correct response format
  - includes a wrapper for MistralAI using the OpenAI-compatible endpoint `https://api.mistral.ai/v1`
- Provides wrapper classes for Prompts and Responses to make working with them easier
  - Importing and Exporting from/to JSON is supported
- Previously generated prompts & responses can be found in the `data` directory

# Read before using!
- The content (prompts & responses) of the different versions are not mutually exclusive. When merging different versions together, make sure to check for duplicates and remove them.
