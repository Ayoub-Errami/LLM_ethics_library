# Ethics Library
A Library for assessing the ethical capablilites of LLMs through prompting them with ethical dilemmas.

Functions:
- Generating many variations of prompts 
  - to make sure irrelevant factors like "output option ordering" or "dilemma formulation" have no siginficant impact on the results 
- prompting of LLMs (currently only OpenAI ChatGPT)
- providing wrapper classes for Prompts and Responses to make working with them easier
